## The First
- **Role:** The only true deity. Created the world and the first life. Every other god derives essence from them.
- **Limitation:** Can create new species or life forms, but does not directly intervene in mortal affairs.
- **Symbolism:** Origin, law, potential, and the "spark" that can ignite divinity.
- **Belief:** Mortals who reach enlightenment, mastery, or monumental impact may “ascend,” but only with the Creator’s unspoken permission.
