## The First
- **Role:** The only true deity. Created the world and the first life. Every other god derives essence from them.
- **Limitation:** Can create new species or life forms, but does not directly intervene in mortal affairs.
- **Symbolism:** Origin, law, potential, and the "spark" that can ignite divinity.
- **Belief:** Mortals who reach enlightenment, mastery, or monumental impact may “ascend,” but only with the Creator’s unspoken permission.
## The Ascended
- **Origin:** Former mortals who transcended. Their mortal deeds shaped the domain they now embody.
- **Nature:** Immortal but not omniscient. They can die (rarely) or lose power if forgotten.
- **Rule:** Upon ascension, each must claim a _domain_—a natural law, concept, or emotion not yet claimed. They then become the divine expression of that force.
## Rules of Ascension
- A mortal must achieve an act that permanently alters the world or reality.
- The Creator grants ascension silently—there is no ritual, only realization.
- Upon ascension, they must _choose_ or _discover_ their domain; it manifests from their mortal legacy.
- Two gods cannot share a domain, though domains can border or overlap (e.g., War and Vengeance).
## Cosmological Implications
- The pantheon constantly grows and shifts as new gods arise.
- There are no “children” of gods by blood—only disciples who may rise.
- Conflict is common: domains can encroach on one another, and ambition drives divine politics.
- The Creator is absent but ever-present, the “sun” around which all divinity orbits.
