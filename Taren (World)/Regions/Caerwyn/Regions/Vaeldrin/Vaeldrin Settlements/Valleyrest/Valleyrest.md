# Biography
Valleyrest is a small town of around 160 people. It is settled in the valley of two mountain ranges and acts a stop for people traveling between the two cities, [[Polsfield]] and [[Celes]].

Most of the money made in [[Valleyrest]] comes from the passing by of merchants and others, spending their coin at [[The Valley's Rest]] for lodging. Other methods of income are small mines that produce a small amount of coal and iron, furs, and timber mined from a local forest.

[[Valleyrest]] is a few hundred years old and has seen slow steady growth as [[Vaeldrin]] grows more powerful and trade increases.
