**Backstory:** Ferrin grew up in the merchant roads between the mountain pass and the lowlands. His mother was an elf mapmaker who vanished on an expedition; his father, a human caravan guard who later retired to run a roadside inn. Ferrin learned both trades, navigation and hospitality, but chose the latter after a bandit raid left him too scarred for the road. He inherited _[[The Valley’s Rest]]_ from and older gentleman who had lived in [[Valleyrest]] and had no one to take over after his death.
