**Backstory:** Ferrin grew up in the merchant roads between the mountain pass and the lowlands. His mother was an elf mapmaker who vanished on an expedition; his father, a human caravan guard who later retired to run _[[The Valley's Rest]]_ in _[[Valleyrest]]_.

He inherited _[[The Valley's Rest]]_ from his father after his passing.
