# Overview
This cave holds an ancient dungeon that for the last 20 years seems to be expanding out of the mountain that it sits in. Several attempts have been made to board up the entrance and bury it, but it always seems to break free. The people of *[[Valleyrest]]* are forbidden to enter the cave due to some deaths that happened some years ago when some adventurers tried to explore it.


# The Tavern
The players are gathered at *[[Valleyrest]]* in the evening on a dreary and rainy day. There are about thirty people gathered in the tavern enjoying dinner and socializing.

A hum of chatter and conversation is had as the inn's tavern is filled, about thirty some people. The seml. The place is busy, but not crowded.

Carrick is already in the tavern, enjoying some food and drink when his younger brother, Taren enters. He approaches Carrick and takes a seat.

> "Are you going to see Lysaen when you're in the city?"
> "Lysaen left for Rivermere a few weeks back. I take it he didn't stop to say goodbye?"
> "Father said that it was time that he proved himself and his knowledge at the _[[Rivermere Arcane Institution|institution]]_. That Lysaen was reaching the limits of father's teachings and that he would benefit studying under one of the scholars. A *[[Doctor Rivian]]* I believe."

Leaving:
> "I best go before they start looking for me. I snuck out of my room and ran down here. I suspect Seris is probably freaking out about now."
> "Have fun in Rivermere, I know you'll find yourself there."

Taren leaves.

As Taren leaves he passes by Moses as he's walking in. Moses sits in the chair that Taren was just occupying
