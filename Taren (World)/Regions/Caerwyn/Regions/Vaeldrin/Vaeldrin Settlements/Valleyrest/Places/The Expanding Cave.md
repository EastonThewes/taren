# Overview
This cave holds an ancient dungeon that for the last 20 years seems to be expanding out of the mountain that it sits in. Several attempts have been made to board up the entrance and bury it, but it always seems to break free. The people of *[[Valleyrest]]* are forbidden to enter the cave due to some deaths that happened some years ago when some adventurers tried to explore it.


# The Tavern
The players are gathered at *[[Valleyrest]]* in the evening on a dreary and rainy day. There are about thirty people gathered in the tavern enjoying dinner and socializing. 

Carrick is already in the tavern, enjoying some food and drink when his younger brother, Taren enters. He approaches Carrick and takes a seat.
