# Overview
This cave holds an ancient dungeon that for the last 20 years seems to be expanding out of the mountain that it sits in. Several attempts have been made to board up the entrance and bury it, but it always seems to break free. The people of *[[Valleyrest]]* are forbidden to enter the cave due to some deaths that happened some years ago when some adventurers tried to explore it.

# The Tavern
The players are gathered at *[[Valleyrest]]* in the evening on a dreary and rainy day. There are about thirty people gathered in the tavern enjoying dinner and socializing.

>***"From outside the frame a man walks to the front door, opens it and steps inside. Cut to the inside of The Valley's Rest, lit by the flickering fireplace, casting a warm glow to the interior. A hum of chatter and conversation is had as the inn's tavern is filled, about thirty some people. The smell of roasted vegetables and spiced ale linger in the air. Our camera focuses on Carrick, as he brushes the rain off his shoulders."***
>***"Mason would you like to describe your character?"*** 

*Allow him to describe his character*

>***"'You're early.', the man behind the bar says as he's pouring a mug of ale. As he says that a half-orc man sitting at the bar turns around, raises his tankard to Carrick and turns back around continuing his conversation with Ferrin"***

>***"Carrick found his usual spot spot near the hearth. He leaned back, ordered and air and let the fire on his back soak into him after a long day. He rests his elbows on the table and wrapped his hands around the mug and watched the door."***

Carrick is already in the tavern, enjoying some food and drink when his younger brother, Taren enters. He approaches Carrick and takes a seat.

***"The night moved gently as Carrick sits in his chair. Not before too long, the door to the tavern opens and in walks a man who you recognize Carrick. It is your younger brother, Taren. He spots you sitting in the back of the tavern and approaches you."***

Conversation Beats:
Taren reading the letter.
> "Seris says you're heading for Rivermere tomorrow. She tried to hide the letter hoping to spare my feelings."

Lysaen left for Rivermere also
> "Are you going to see Lysaen when you're in the city?"
> "Lysaen left for Rivermere a few weeks back. I take it he didn't stop to say goodbye?"
> "Father said that it was time that he proved himself and his knowledge at the _[[Rivermere Arcane Institution|institution]]_. That Lysaen was reaching the limits of father's teachings and that he would benefit studying under one of the scholars. A *[[Doctor Rivian]]* I believe."

Leaving:
> "I best go before they start looking for me. I snuck out of my room and ran down here. I suspect Seris is probably freaking out about now."
> "Have fun in Rivermere, I know you'll find yourself there."

Taren leaves.

As Taren leaves he passes by Moses as he's walking in. Moses sits in the chair that Taren was just occupying

>***"With that, Taren give you a hug and leaves. As he's leaving he passes by another man you know, Moses. He approaches the table you're sitting at and fills the chair that Taren just did. Hunter will you describe your character***

*Allow them to RP*

>***Cut to a the staircase of the tavern where a man is currently walking down. Dakota will you describe your character?"***

*Let him describe his character*

> [!quote]
***You walk down the stairs to a full tavern. Most seats are taken up and the bar is currently full. There is however a table that has a few chairs open. A few tables over from Carrick and Moses, we see a Drow man sitting alone at a table with a stack of books and a small sprawled out across the table. Joseph would you like to describe your character?***

*Let him describe his character*

> [!quote]
***Would you like to approach Joseph's character?***

*Let them RP for a bit, jumping back and forth between Mason and Hunter and Joseph and Dakota*

Here is the inciting incident:
> [!quote]
>***"Smash cut, the door to the tavern suddenly flies open, standing in the doorway is a human woman, drenched from the rain outside. She looks distressed and slowly walks into the tavern. Everyone is turned and looking at her as she says 'He went in... he... went in there'. Ferrin behind the bar responds, 'Ethel, who went in?'. 'Tomas... those stupid boys dared him to go in there and he did.' she says as she stands there shaking. Ferrin asks again 'Where did Tomas go Ethel?'. 'The mountains spite.' she says. When she mutters those words you hear a audible gasp from a few of the patrons. '. That evil place  we've boarded up all these years. Those damn boys dared him to go into that dungeon and he hasn't came back out. Someone has to find him for me. I can't let me boy die in there'. The patrons look around the tavern at each other, not knowing what to do."***

*If the group doesn't bite*

>***"She frantically looks around and pulls out a small sack she has,'10 gold for the ones that find my boy. This is all I have.' " ***

*Hopefully they bite on this*

# Getting to the Dungeon

Its dark and its raining out which will make it difficult to get there. Have them roll **survival** or **nature** with advantage for Mason and Hunter to get there. DC of 15

If they pass they get there in fifteen minutes, if they fail it takes about thirty minutes. This affects if they get there when Tomas is reading the script or if it happens when they are halfway through the dungeon.

They make it to the mouth of the cave and when they head in they see a stone door that has been pushed off its hinges and an attempt to board up the doorway with wood planks. There is a small gap where a child looks to be able to get through.

*Ask how they would like to try to get in*
If attacking, AC15 to break through
If strength, DC15 to rip it off the hinges
