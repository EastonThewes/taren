# Biography

Often referred to as "Whitewall" or "The White Walled City", Celes sits atop a small plateau overlooking some fertile lowlands and the intersection of multiple trade routes. The walls, a magically treated marble that looks pristine, that reflect sunlight, shining as a beacon from miles away.

Inside there is another wall, not as pristine as this one, but houses the oldest districts in Celes
