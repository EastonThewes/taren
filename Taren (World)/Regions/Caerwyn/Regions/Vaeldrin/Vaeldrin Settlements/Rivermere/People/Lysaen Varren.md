**Backstory:**
The oldest and favorite child of the Varren family.  Naturally gifted in the arcane arts and treated extremely well by his father, [[Theron Varren]]. Lysaen has had everything catered and cared for his entire life and is in turn became arrogant and spoiled.

From a young child Lysaen has been personally tutored by his father in the arcane arts and wizardry, showing extraordinary progress at a young age. He desires greatly to be exactly like his father, even showing the same disappointment towards [[Carrick Varren]] and some of his other flaws.

Growing up, Lysaen's father pushed him to his full potential, which meant that Lysaen was often distanced from his siblings, but most notably [[Carrick Varren]], as the skill gap between the two grew ever farther apart. Lysaen was closest to [[Seris Varren]] as him and her studied and trained together.

As everyone grew older, Lysaen continued his studies with his father, still receiving majority of his attention as [[Theron Varren]] began to lose hope in [[Carrick Varren]], and seeing [[Seris Varren]] acting more as a peacekeeper of the family.

Lysaen had just recently left for the [[Rivermere Arcane Institution]] as he has reached the limit of what his father can teach him.
