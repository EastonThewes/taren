# Overview
The Grand Merchant's Council is the ruling body of [[Vaeldrin]], based in the bustling capital, [[Rivermere]]. Unlike monarchies or military-led states, [[Vaeldrin]] is governed primarily by commerce. Wealth, trade influence, and the ability to control critical resources determine political power. Every major merchant house, guild, and trade consortium has representation, making the council both a legislative and executive authority.

# Structure
## The Councilors of the Ledger
### Appointment of a Councilor
- When a seat becomes vacant, a candidate must be proposed by either an existing councilor
- Majority vote is required by the remaining councilors. If in the event of a tie, the [[First Merchant]] is the tie-breaker.

- Any councilor can be proposed for removal due to misconduct, failure to maintain influence, or harm to the city

- Secret ballots may be used to allow councilors to vote without external pressure.
