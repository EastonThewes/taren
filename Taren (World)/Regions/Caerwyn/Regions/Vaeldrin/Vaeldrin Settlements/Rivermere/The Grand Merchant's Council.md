# Overview
The Grand Merchant's Council is the ruling body of [[Vaeldrin]], based in the bustling capital, [[Rivermere]]. Unlike monarchies or military-led states, [[Vaeldrin]] is governed primarily by commerce. Wealth, trade influence, and the ability to control critical resources determine political power. Every major merchant house, guild, and trade consortium has representation, making the council both a legislative and executive authority.
