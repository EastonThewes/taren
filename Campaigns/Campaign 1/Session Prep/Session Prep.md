# Session 1

**Timeline of Events**
- Players start out in the *[[The Valley's Rest]]* in the evening on a rainy day
- After some role playing, *[[Ethel Baines]]* runs in and is in frantic, delirious state. Here son has gone missing and she has been told by his friends that he went into the dungeon on the edge of town
- She begs any and everyone to please go look for her son. Most people refuse to go in there, saying that by now he's probably already dead. This is the lead in for the players to pop up and be heroes
- The players should head towards the dungeon. Have them roll a **survival** or **nature** check to see how fast they get there
- The dungeon sits in a rock wall. It is obvious that there was an attempt to board it up, but it literally seems like its busting out of the mountain
- *Generic Dungeon Fun*
- Right when they're about to enter into the room with the alter they hear the boy talking. He's reading an ancient book. When the characters arrive, they see the book floats into the air and then explodes and a wave of energy shoots out. This shock will be noticed from hundreds of miles away. The book is left charred, but maybe useable?
- They are shook up and then take the boy back to the town
- The pulse awakes a low level undead orcish mage who resurrects some orc warriors to build back up the army.
- This undead orc mage exists in another crypt a bit further away from the current one.
- His goals: build back up the army, destroy anything, get back to what's his name. He'd probably spend the next few sessions sending warriors to attack caravans to gather supplies. So a few caravans heading into and leaving *[[Valleyrest]]* are attacked.
- Probably ask the players to investigate. 
- Find an overturned wagon, some dead horses, dead men and one dead orc. Wearing an unknown insignia? Maybe someone else might know who this belongs to?
- Attacks continue on *[[Valleyrest]]* and *[[Stonebridge]]* 
- Track them back to another dungeon. This one bigger. With traps and the mage for a fun fight. Have some type of magical artifact? Maybe one of the five relics?
