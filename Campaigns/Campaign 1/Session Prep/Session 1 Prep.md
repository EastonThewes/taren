# Session 1

Running the *[[The Expanding Cave]]*



Plan to end session here after they give him back to mom.

- The next morning animals seem to be in a panic?
- The pulse awakes a low level undead orcish mage who resurrects some orc warriors to build back up the army.
- This undead orc mage exists in another crypt a bit further away from the current one.
- His goals: build back up the army, destroy anything, get back to what's his name. He'd probably spend the next few sessions sending warriors to attack caravans to gather supplies. So a few caravans heading into and leaving *[[Valleyrest]]* are attacked.
- Probably ask the players to investigate. 
- Find an overturned wagon, some dead horses, dead men and one dead orc. Wearing an unknown insignia? Maybe someone else might know who this belongs to?
- Attacks continue on *[[Valleyrest]]* and *[[Stonebridge]]* 
- Track them back to another dungeon. This one bigger. With traps and the mage for a fun fight. Have some type of magical artifact? Maybe one of the five relics?
