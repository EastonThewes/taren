## **Timeline of Events**
- Players start out in the *[[The Valley's Rest]]* in the evening on a rainy day
- Carrick (Mason) is already there enjoying some food and drink, waiting for Moses (Hunter) to arrive
- Ask Mason what his character is doing and some descriptions.
- In walks Carrick's youngest brother, Taren Varren, walks in and approaches Carrick

Conversation Notes
> "Seris says you're heading for Rivermere tomorrow. She tried to hide the letter hoping to spare my feelings but I found it."
> "Lysaen left "


- Start with Mason's character relaxing at the bar when his younger brother comes in asking him about him leaving. Saying that his sister tried to hide it from him so that he would not be hurt.
- Before he leaves, he lets Mason's character know that his oldest brother left for Rivermere months ago.
- Then Hunter's character will probably walk in
- After some role playing, *[[Ethel Baines]]* runs in and is in frantic, delirious state. Here son, *[[Tomas Baines]]* has gone missing and she has been told by his friends that he went into the sealed cave after they dared him.
- She begs any and everyone to please go look for her son. Most people refuse to go in there, saying that by now he's probably already dead. Saying that that place is 'cursed' This is the lead in for the players to pop up and be heroes

- On the way to the adventure, have some wolves attack

- The players should head towards the dungeon. Have them roll a **survival** or **nature** check to see how fast they get there
- The dungeon sits in a rock wall. The entrance a collapsed stone arch, boards split outward. It is obvious that there was an attempt to board it up, but it literally seems like its busting out of the mountain.
- Carvings in the wall depicting orcs worshipping a star?
- *Generic Dungeon Fun Time* 
- This dungeon was part of the ancient orc empire and was used as a ritual site for some lower level casters. Two of them are 
- Right when they're about to enter into the room with the alter they hear the boy talking. He's reading an ancient tome. When the characters arrive, they see the book floats into the air and then explodes and a wave of astral–necrotic energy tears outward; stalactites shake; faint echo of a roar far beyond the material plane. shoots out. This shock will be noticed from hundreds of miles away. Tome falls, charred, but glowing faintly with runes, partial content can be deciphered later.
- Return Tomas to town. He’s feverish, mutters in his sleep (“The eye opens,” “The forge calls”).

Plan to end session here after they give him back to mom.

- The next morning animals seem to be in a panic?
- The pulse awakes a low level undead orcish mage who resurrects some orc warriors to build back up the army.
- This undead orc mage exists in another crypt a bit further away from the current one.
- His goals: build back up the army, destroy anything, get back to what's his name. He'd probably spend the next few sessions sending warriors to attack caravans to gather supplies. So a few caravans heading into and leaving *[[Valleyrest]]* are attacked.
- Probably ask the players to investigate. 
- Find an overturned wagon, some dead horses, dead men and one dead orc. Wearing an unknown insignia? Maybe someone else might know who this belongs to?
- Attacks continue on *[[Valleyrest]]* and *[[Stonebridge]]* 
- Track them back to another dungeon. This one bigger. With traps and the mage for a fun fight. Have some type of magical artifact? Maybe one of the five relics?
