The Drow possessed an sword made of was is known as Star Metal. The Drow were unaware of what exactly the sword was made of, but knew it was rare and was a vital component to their reign against the Orcs.\n\nAn Orc Mage named Uma the Wise was able to infiltrate the Drow defenses and was able to steal the sword and escape to the Overworld and away from the Drow. \n\n(This part is where I need to fill in the blanks)\nSomehow over the next 30 years Uma ascended to Lichdom and planned to use the Star Metal sword to kill the Guardian of the Astral Forge (Space Leviathan) and use the Astral Forge to arm his army and take back the underdark from the Drow.\n\nWhen the lich started performing rituals to make it to the astral plane the space leviathan could feel this and began fighting against it but knew it would lose, so it manifested a human (Hunter's Character) and had it seek out adventurers to take down the lich.\n\nEventually the manifestation was able to find a group and take down the lich and seal it away. The group broke the sword down into five relics and hid them away in dungeons to prevent anyone from finding them and using them for evil again.\n\nOver the next thousands of years the lich has been trying to escape and has been eating away at the seal that keeps it locked up. The space leviathan knows that its a matter of time before the lich escapes so it manifests the hero again and leads it towards finding a new set of adventurers to stop the lich"}
