## The Tavern

The players find themselves at *[[The Valley's Rest]]* on a rainy evening. Its a quiet night, a soft piano is playing in the background as about twenty-odd people enjoy their meals and ale.

*[[Ethel Baines]]* bursts through the door, drenched from the rain, looking frantic and breathing heavy.

Read this to the players

> As your listening to the soft lull of the piano play and enjoying your meal, the door that leads into The Valley's Rest bursts open slamming into the wall. Everyone in the bar turns their head and see standing in the doorway is a small human woman, drenched from the rain and franticly walking into the tavern.
> "He's went in. Oh my he went in there." she says. "Who did? Ethel who went in?" says Ferrin from behind the bar. "Tomas. He went into the ruins. Those stupid boys dared him to go in and he did.". When she says this the whole tavern goes silent. She starts walking around the tavern, "Please you have to help me"
