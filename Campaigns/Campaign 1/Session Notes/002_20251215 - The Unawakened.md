## Session Summary
---
> [!tldr] [[002_20251215 - The Unawakened]]

The party decides to leave the dungeon and get Tomas back to Valleyrest. Before leaving they check on Tomas, learning that his eyes are grayed with purple specs and he is in a comatose state. As they're heading back to [[Valleyrest]], Moses points out to the group that they are being stalked by wolves, so the party decides to stand and fight.

After a fight that leaves Moses unconscious, the group carries on and makes their way back to town, entering into [[The Valley's Rest]], finding [[Ferrin Bright]], [[Brother Harl]], and [[Ethel Baines]] sitting at a lone table in the middle of the tavern. [[Brother Harl]] heals [[Moses]] and when he tries on [[Tomas Baines]], nothing works. The group inquires with Harl about the black stone, emberred book, and the chest plate [[Kol Badar]] has. He is unable to provide any real answers. The group decides to take [[Tomas Baines]] to [[Seris Varren]] the following day to see if she can provide any answers.

Carrick heads to speak with [[G]]
