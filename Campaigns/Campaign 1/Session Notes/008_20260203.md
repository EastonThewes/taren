## Scenes
---
- [ ] Going to speak to [[Dr. Francis Montague]] about the [[Book of Cinders]]
	- [ ] He asks where they got this from
		- [ ] If they disclose that they got it from a dungeon from [[Valleyrest]], he will ask if that was source of the boom and strong arcana that was released last week
		- [ ] Only knows that it was a strong sonic boom like and a heavy release of arcana. He and a group of other professors spent a couple days searching for a source near [[Celes]] but were unscuccessful
	- [ ] He would note that it does emit a strong sense of transmutative magic, as well as necromancy.
	- [ ] Hard to tell what exactly it came from or what it was before. Could be possible to reverse the transmutation if given enough time or strong enough magic
	- [ ] Asks to keep it and spend some time researching it
- [ ] Heading to Oakhurst
