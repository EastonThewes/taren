17th of Greenshade, 1147

The session stars with [[Carrick Varren]] arriving at [[The Valley's Rest]] and waiting for [[Moses]] to arrive. Carrick's little brother, [[Taren Varren]], arrived there to say goodbye before Carrick left for [[Rivermere]]. Taren also explained to Carrick that [[Lysaen Varren]] and his parents left for Rivermere last week, which was unknown to Carrick. Taren said goodbye and left. Shortly after Taren's departure,  Moses arrived at the Valley's Rest and met up with Carrick at a table by the hearth. Moses explained to him that he had seen a sign for aid and Carrick kind of called him crazy. They both sat and conversed at their table by the fire.

Shortly after Moses's arrival we're introduced to [[Nahlir]] where he insulted the ale and spit on the counter. After this Nahlir scanned the tavern and made his way over to a table with [[Kol Badar]], who was sitting alone and researching a map that was sprawled over the table. Nahlir tried to introduce Kol to some of his wares, one being a topple less top that could spin forever. Kol did not seem amused by this. Kol and Nahlir both shared their coincidence that they are both outsiders to this town.

Suddenly the door the Valley's Rest bursts open, with a drenched [[Ethel Baines]] standing in the doorway. Shocked, Ethel enters the tavern, speaking that her son, [[Tomas Baines]] had went into [[The Mountain's Spite]], after being dared by some other children. She pleas for anyone to help her. Moses speaks to Carrick about helping her, mentioning the sign that he saw, and the both of them agree to help her. Nahlir convinces Kol to help out, citing that maybe the dungeon might have some of the answers he was looking for about those orcs he spoke about.

The four of them set out in the cold, rainy night to find their way to the dungeon. After a bit of difficulty navigating in the cold and rain, the group eventually finds their way to the mouth of the cave, where they enter in hopes of finding Tomas. The group approaches the barricaded entryway, with a giant stone door laying down on the ground beside it. Carrick hacks away at the rotted timber and the group enters into the first room of the dungeon. After some investigation of the room, it appears to have once been a colorful mural painted on the walls, but time has caused the painting to fade and become difficult to determine what it was. Moses notices a spot that seems to be in good enough condition to tell what it is, a group of ancient orcs worshipping a single star in the sky. Carrick moves to open the door to enter in the next room when the ancient stone statue animates and tries to strike him. After a short battle with the statue, it is defeated. Fortunately, only Moses was struck during the fight.

The group moved on to the second room, where they were met with a riddle. While Kol tried to convince Nahlir to unwarp his hand so that he may cut it, Moses walked to the door and wiped some of his blood on the door and the door opened. Moving on, the group entered into an ancient study where there was a bookshelf full of ruined books. After some investigating, Kol found a ruined book, but with the single word, 'Experiments' written on the cover in Orcish. 

After leaving the study, the group moved on to what appeared to be a tomb with three unmarked sarcophagi. The group inspected the tomb without finding anything of interest and moved on to the last route. As they travelled down the hallway, a sudden blast of purple energy flew down the hallways, knocking the party down. After getting up, they rushed into what they learned is an altar room. Lying in the middle is an unconscious Tomas with a burnt tome on the ground  beside him. Carrick checks on Tomas to make sure he is still alive while Moses looks over the tome. Moses deduces that the tome is probably magical, due to the fact that it is currently smoldering and full of embers, but doesn't disintegrate. As the group gathers up and attempts to leave, two undead orcs make their way into the alter room. The group makes quick work of them, killing them in just one round.

The session ends here.
