## Recap
---
It is the night of the 17th of Greenshade, in the ye

[[Carrick Varren]] arrived at [[The Valley's Rest]] in waiting for [[Moses]] to arrive. Carrick's little brother, [[Taren Varren]], arrived there to say goodbye before Carrick left for [[Rivermere]]. Taren also explained to Carrick that [[Lysaen Varren]] and his parents left for Rivermere last week, which was unknown to Carrick. Taren said goodbye and left. Shortly after Taren's departure,  Moses arrived at the Valley's Rest and met up with Carrick at a table by the hearth. Moses explained to him that he had seen a sign for aid and Carrick kind of called him crazy. They both sat and conversed at their table by the fire.

Shortly after Moses's arrival we're introduced to [[Nahlir]] where he insulted the ale and spit on the counter. After this Nahlir scanned the tavern and made his way over to a table with [[Kol Badar]], who was sitting alone and researching a map that was sprawled over the table. Nahlir tried to introduce Kol to some of his wares, one being a topple less top that could spin forever. Kol did not seem amused by this. Kol and Nahlir both shared their coincidence that they are both outsiders to this town.

Suddenly the door the Valley's Rest bursts open, with a drenched [[Ethel Baines]] standing in the doorway. Shocked, Ethel enters the tavern, speaking that her son, [[Tomas Baines]] had went into [[The Mountain's Spite]], after being dared by some other children. She pleas for anyone to help her. Moses speaks to Carrick about helping her, mentioning the sign that he saw, and the both of them agree to help her. Nahlir convinces Kol to help out, citing that maybe the dungeon might have some of the answers he was looking for about those orcs he spoke about.

The four of them set out
