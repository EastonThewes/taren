## Scenes
---
- [ ] The players leaving the dungeon and heading out into the night back to [[Valleyrest]]
- [ ] As they're heading back to town, they feel something stalking them, a pack of three wolves can be seen stalking them as they are walking back (May or may not attack)
- [ ] The party brings [[Tomas Baines]] back to [[The Valley's Rest]] to his mother, [[Ethel Baines]] and the party and Ethel realize that he isn't waking up and that his eyes are grayed over with specs of purple floating in them. He is in some type of comatose state
- [ ] They speak with someone ([[Brother Harl]] or [[Ferrin Bright]]) and they speak of story that he heard from a couple merchants from [[Celes]] speaking of a story of an apple that can cure any ailment that can be bought in [[Oakhurst]]
	- [ ] Tomas was the only one to see what he saw before the explosion. If he is brought back, maybe he can shed some light on what he saw
	- [ ] If he is brought back, he can tell the party what he read
	- [ ] They should do it because they're nice :)
- [ ] The party leaves [[Valleyrest]] heading for [[Oakhurst]]

## Secrets and Clues
---
- [ ] The experiments book is from [[Mol]], who was attempting to find a way to get to the [[Astral Forge]]
- [ ] The blast had awakened a good number of the undead orcs, who had died long ago. They're coming up and out of the ground in places and are attacking
- [ ] [[Mol]] will try to gather up a small group of undead orcs to try to get [[Uma]] back and start up the undead army again.
- [ ] [[Mol]] takes shelter in another one of the dungeons created long ago by [[Uma]]. This one is unknown to anyone in [[Valleyrest]] and must either be found by following an orc back or maybe something else?
- [ ] The book of embers was an old book given to [[Mol]] by [[Uma]]
