# Biography
Often referred to as "Whitewall" or "The White Walled City", Celes sits atop a small plateau overlooking some fertile lowlands and the intersection of multiple trade routes. All of the city exists within the walls, a magically treated limestone that looks pristine. The walls reflect sunlight, shining as a beacon from miles away.

Inside there is another wall, not as pristine as this one, but houses the oldest districts in Celes
