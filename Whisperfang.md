Whisperfang is an ancient sword around four-thousand years old. The metal of the blade was forged by [[Astral Metal]] that had found its way to the material plane after being shot out by accident from the [[Astral Forge]]

An ancient dwarven civilization found the metal deep in a cave underground and learned to work it. The forged the first part of the sword, the blade and the hilt. The result was an extremely sharp blade that never loses its edge or becomes weak.

Eventually the dwarven civilization collapses and Whisperfang's where abouts become lost. Around -3144, [[Bemril Dagoth]] brings Whisperfang to the Underdark. He names it "Whisperfang" referencing how the blade would murmur when used. How the blade seems to mu How he obtained the sword is unknown. At this point the sword is very strong, but not a crazy powerful weapon like it will soon become.

During one of the battles between [[The Kingdom of Dagoth]] and [[The Jagged Rock Tribe]], Whisperfang is stolen and is not seen again, except in some cases. Some orcish weaponsmiths add the spinal core and pommel to sword. Whisperfang eventually makes its way to [[Uma]], who is able to recognize that the blade is made from [[Astral Metal]] and could be used to take over the [[Astral Forge]]. He is able to imbue the pommel with [[The Whisperstone]]
