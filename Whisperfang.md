Whisperfang is an ancient sword around two-thousand years old. The metal of the blade was forged by [[Astral Metal]] that had found its way to the material plane after being shot out by accident from the [[Astral Forge]]

An ancient dwarven civilization found the metal deep in a cave underground and learned to work it. The forged the first part of the sword, the blade and the hilt. The result was an extremely sharp blade that never loses its edge or becomes weak.

Eventually the dwarven civilization collapses and Whisperfang's where abouts become lost.
